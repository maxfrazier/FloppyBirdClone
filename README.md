Important notes if you want to follow the tutorial:
-When creating a cavas, set the Rendor Mode to Screen Space - Camera with and Rendor Camera as Main Camvera
-Uncheck the box on the Inspector on the Game Over canvas so it will only show when you get a game over
-You'll need to create a hit box for the ceiling to trigger a game over
